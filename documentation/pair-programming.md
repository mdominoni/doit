# Pair programming

## What is it?

Pair programming is based on two developers working side by side. One is the pilot (or driver) who is writing the actual code, the other one is the co pilot (or navigator), who is task to "supervise" the pilot for errors and "enforce" the pairing technique

## Methodology

Its used primarily in agile and its based on exchanging impressions, debating problems, finding solution and develop creative ideas.
For the pairing to work, it's necessary to change roles constantly in short time intervals. Also, is recommended that there is no fixed pair and all rotate so everyone has an idea about the origin of the complete code and the success of the project dont depend on the different persons involved. If someone is not available doesn't put the entire project at risk and the rest of the team can compensate its absence

## Good practices
There is different ways to pair developers, one of them is pair a senior with a junior so the senior can pass through knowledge with practice and the junior have innovating ideas to provide.
What can each type of developer can bring to the experience? (but not limited to)

###### Beginner
- Able to participate as navigator, in particular to intervene appropriately
- Able to participate as driver, in particular to explain code while writing it

###### Intermediate
- Can tell the right moment to give up the keyboard and switch roles
- Can tell the right moment to “steal” the keyboard and switch roles

###### Advanced
- Able to "drop in" when another pair has been working on a task and pick up the navigator role smoothly

Other type of pairing is between diferente areas where the diferente experience of each collaborator can nourish the other one to generate a better result.

## Work space
Each developer must have its own mouse, keyboard and screen where both see the same. If they are not in the same physical place it's necessary to have a direct communication line and be able to access and see in real time the changes.

###### Warnings
In case that the pair programming is taking place in the same office, if on entering the room you spot any programmer wearing an audio headset, take that as a "negative" sign. Not only is pairing probably not practiced in the team but the conditions for successful adoptions are likely not met

# Advantages
- More discipline, less chance of distractions
- Better code, there are two people designing together and cooperating what develops creativity by making ideas appear that, if working alone, would not appear. On the other hand, the fact of having to justify an idea to another person causes problems to be detected and resolved more quickly since a debate begins due to different perceptions
- Consistent workflow, one attends interruptions while the other continues with the workflow
- Better morale, more interaction between developers
- Everyone knows the code, when couples rotate frequently
- Knowledge share
- Generates a faster sense of belonging
- Fewer interruptions since people tend to interrupt less when they are more than single person
- Fewer errors since there is one person writing and the other trying to detect them. Normally it is not yourself who finds your mistakes more quickly but your team mates
- Large reduction in coordination efforts, since there are N / 2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers

# Disadvantages
- Senior developers can get tired of explaining to juniors
- Preferences about working alone
- Complicated to measure individual performance
- The agendas may not coincide and generate dead time or development without pair programming practice
- Complications when doing it remotely
- Makes projects more expensive since two people working together work slower than two people working individually, this is true in cases where the team is poorly matched
- It only works well if there is harmony in the team since if two paired people get along badly it could slow down development with personal problems.
